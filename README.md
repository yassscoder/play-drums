*Play drums project is a Javascript app to have some fun playing drums. It allows you to play different sounds by clicking buttons in the app or pressing some keys in your keyboard.*

*We decided to pair most of the time in order to solve problems in partnership. Having an extra pair of eyes on the code helps us to face issues.*
